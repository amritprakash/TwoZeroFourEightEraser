Slide.me: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Slide.me app for Android!

This is an app developed by Amrit Prakash Singh. The app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.)) created by you is stored on your device only, 
and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

It has a feature to share/post picture + puzzle to any social media sites. If you utilize this feature, your shared image will be temporarily saved to google cloud 
in order to share it with the people you opted to share the picture.

All the saved picture will get automatically deleted after max 24 hours from the google cloud and the shared link will be valid only for the 24 hours.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, 
please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, Amrit Prakash Singh. Bangalore, India. career.amritprakash@gmail.com, admin@paridhi.io
